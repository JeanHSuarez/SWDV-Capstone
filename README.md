The project is a timekeeping web application tailored-fit to a particular mode of
service in the healthcare industry. There are many timekeeping applications in the market
today. Almost all of these timekeeping applications available in the market are either too
broad or demands a steep learning curve for users. The problem with being too broad is
that this would not address the empirical problem at hand and instead creates more
unnecessary processes, and thus, create more problems. This project focuses on solving
the problem of a concrete scenario of a facility-based psychiatric rehabilitation service
industry.
